## Project Description
I chose to write a simple program to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
I first created a Trello board to outline the steps I'd need to go through. The first iteration was extremely messy given that I was using just a couple of functions to do all the work. I then decided to have smaller functions, each taking care of a small aspect of the game. After that I fixed bugs and other irregularities. I then tested the input validation that I implemented with weird inputs (special characters, blank inputs, etc.) and corner cases to check if the program would react correctly.
