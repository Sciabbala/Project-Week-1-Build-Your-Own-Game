## Project Description
I chose to write a simple program to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
I created a Trello board to outline the steps I'd need to go through, coded the bulk of the program and fixed bugs and other irregularities right after. I then tested weird inputs and corner cases to check if the program would react correctly.
